## An example of the SuperSmoother in Python, Using data from IG Index

Whilst myself I do not trade in Bitcoin because I don't agree with what it has become, I used Bitcoin because it gains traction with users and it seems prevalent here. My thoughts around crypto is not up for discussion here. It works just as well with other epic id's in any market. Please feel free to try this to fit with your own trading style. 

Please pass this around and don't forget to donate, A lot of work has gone into this and a few beers doesn't hurt especially if it helps you gain some profit! Please don't forget to join in the discussion and also checkout some of my other projects!
